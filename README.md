# Simple Password Strength Checker with Retry

A Python-based simple password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on key criteria such as length, use of uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program provides a retry mechanism for the user to enter a stronger password if the current one is weak.

## âœ… Features

- Checks for:
  - Minimum length (8 characters)
  - Presence of lowercase letters
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Inclusion of digits
  - Special characters (from: `@#$%^&*!?`)
- Interactive input with real-time feedback
- Provides strength classification:
  - Very Strong
  - Strong
  - Okay
  - Weak
  - Very Weak (prompts retry)
